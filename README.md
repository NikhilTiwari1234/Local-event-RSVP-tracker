# Local Event RSVP Tracker

## Project Description
Local Event RSVP Tracker is a decentralized smart contract that enables users to create, manage, and attend local events using blockchain technology. The contract allows event organizers to sell tickets, track attendees, and manage RSVPs in a transparent and trustless manner.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize event management by integrating blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency in the ticketing process. With this platform, users can securely register for events, and organizers can prevent fraudulent ticket sales and fake attendees.

## Future Scope
- **NFT-Based Ticketing:** Convert tickets into NFTs for better traceability and security.
- **Secondary Marketplace:** Enable resale of tickets in a secure and transparent manner.
- **Event Reputation System:** Implement a rating system for events and organizers.
- **Integration with Wallets:** Support popular crypto wallets for seamless transactions.
- **AI-Powered Event Recommendations:** Suggest events based on user interests and history.

## Key Features
- **Event Creation:** Organizers can create and manage events with details like name, date, and ticket price.
- **Ticket Purchase:** Users can buy tickets directly through the smart contract.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Verify attendees and their ticket count on the blockchain.
- **Event Cancellation:** Organizers can cancel events, preventing further ticket purchases.
